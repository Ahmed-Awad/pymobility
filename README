Description
-----------
This is a python library to simulation of mobility and contact models.

The following mobility models that simulate node movements are available:

- Random Walk
- Random Waypoint
- Random Direction
- Truncated Levy Walk
- Gauss-Markov
- Reference Point Group

In addition to models that simulate node position in time, this library also provides some models that simulate node contacts:
- The Random Contact model, that simulate random contacts in time
- The Model B, as described in [1]

Dependencies
------------
NumPy and Matplotlib
